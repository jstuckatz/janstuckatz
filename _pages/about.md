I am a PhD candidate at [Government Department](http://www.lse.ac.uk/government) of the [London School of Economics and Political Science](www.lse.ac.uk). I study the International Political Economy of Trade with a special emphasis on firm-level analysis.

I conduct research on political alignment between corporations and their employees using large-scale lobbying and campaign contributions in the United States.

I also research on the impact of trade policy uncertainty on firm-level trade and invesment decisions. This includes work together with Oleksandr Shepotylo titled Trade Policy Uncertainty and Trade in Intermediate Goods, where we employ census-like firm-product-destination trade data from Ukraine.

I am prepared to teach courses at the graduate and undergraduate level on International Political Economy and Quantitative Methods.
