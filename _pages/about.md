I am a PhD candidate at [Government Department](http://www.lse.ac.uk/government) of the [London School of Economics and Political Science](www.lse.ac.uk). I study the Political Economy of International Trade and Corporate Influence in Politics. 

I investigate the impact of political uncertainty on firm-level trade and investment, as well as the economic determinants and effects of political alignment between corporations and their employees. Moreover, I study how companies combine lobbying and campaign finance in order to influence politics. My PhD dissertation is supervised by [Prof. Stephanie Rickard](http://personal.lse.ac.uk/rickard/) and [Prof. Kenneth Benoit](http://kenbenoit.net/).  

I make use of machine learning and quantitative text analysis in order to generate original data and employ panel and causal inference methods for observational data. For example, I use structural topic models in order to generate a measure of trade policy uncertainty, and I employ natural language processing to match large scale datasets based un-structured company and occupation names. I have been a visiting student at the [Political Science Department](https://polisci.mit.edu/) of the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](http://www.mit.edu/) throughout the academic year 2017/2018, hosted by [In Prof. In Song Kim](http://web.mit.edu/insong/www/index.html).

I am looking forward to teach courses in International Political Economy, Money in Politics, and Quantitative Methods.
