I am a PhD candidate in Political Science at the [Government Department](http://www.lse.ac.uk/government) at the [London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE)](www.lse.ac.uk). My research agenda focuses on the **Political Economy of Trade** and **Corporate Influence in Politics**, with a special emphasis on firm-level analysis.

In my dissertation, supervised by [Stephanie Rickard](http://personal.lse.ac.uk/rickard/) and [Kenneth Benoit](http://kenbenoit.net/), I build on trade theory to examine the relationship between corporations and politics. Corporations play an increasingly important role in politics today and understanding how corporations influence politics and respond to political change is therefore of growing importance. In the first paper, I examine how the political preferences of firms align with their employees. Using novel matched US firm-employee campaign finance data, I show that asset specificity increases firm-employee political alignment. This paper empirically demonstrates a long-standing expectation from trade theory about firm structure and political alignment. As an important empirical contribution, it links big data on firm and employee donations. The second paper, co-authored with Oleksandr Shepotylo (University of Bradford), investigates the impact of political uncertainty on firm's economic activities. Leveraging unique Ukrainian firm-level data, we show that in line with trade theory, firm imports of capital and intermediate goods are particularly responsive to uncertainty between different trade policies. Our novel measure of uncertainty, based on quantitative text analysis of business news, can easily adapted to other cases where governments face mutually exclusive policy options. In the last paper, I examine the impact of firm-employee political alignment on lobbying activity and effectiveness. The paper reconciles collective action and investment theory perspectives on corporate political activity and links large-scale data on lobbying and campaign donations at the firm-level.  

I have been a visiting student at the [Political Science Department](https://polisci.mit.edu/) of the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](http://www.mit.edu/) throughout the academic year 2017/2018, hosted by [In Song Kim](http://web.mit.edu/insong/www/index.html).

I am looking forward to teaching courses in International Political Economy, Money in Politics, and Quantitative Methods.
