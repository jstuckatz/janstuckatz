* **Political Alignment between Firms and Employees: The Role of Asset Specificity**
  * **Abstract**: In this paper, I investigate the economic sources of individuals’ political
  preferences. When do individual political preferences of people
  align with those of their employers? I theorize that firms and sectors with more specific
  assets are more bound to their geographic location and less adaptable in the case of
  averse economic shocks. Therefore, employees should show more partisan alignment
  if they work in firms or sectors with more specific assets. However, observing both
  company and employee political preferences is difficult in practice.
  First, I match 1,691,790 campaign contribution filings of 85,109 individuals to 874
  publicly listed firms and 850 occupations using US campaign finance data between
  2003 and 2016 using natural language processing techniques
  to automatically identify employer names and employee occupations. Second, I find that employees in companies with more non-mobile assets  are more aligned. Finally, I show that most of the variation in partisan alignment is at the industry level, which goes contrary to new theories emphasizing individual occupation as a source of  political preferences.


* **Political Uncertainty, FDI, and Trade in intermediate Goods: Evidence From Ukrainian Firms**, with Oleksandr Shepotylo, _under review_

  * **Abstract**: We extend a model with heterogeneous firms and argue that trade policy uncertainty (TPU) 
  negatively impacts firm-specific investment and firm-level decision to source intermediate goods. 
  We look at Ukraine’s trade relations with EU and Russia to measure
  TPU and test our predictions. Ukrainian firms faced considerable uncertainty
  with regards to two mutually exclusive trade policies: the conclusion of a free trade
  agreement (FTA) with the European Union or a customs union with Russia. Using
  unique firm-product level data and FDI data of Ukrainian manufacturing firms between
  2003 and 2014, we find a substantive increase in firm-level FDI inflows and
  imported intermediate goods from EU countries, and a decrease in FDI from the Customs
  Union, once uncertainty with regards to the EU FTA is reduced. Moreover,
  more protected goods respond stronger to a reduction in TPU. The novel measure
  of uncertainty can be easily applied to other cases where governments face multiple
  mutually exclusive policy options.
