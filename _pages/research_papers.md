* **Political Alignment between Firms and Employees: The Role of Asset Specificity**
  * **Abstract**: Do individual political preferences of people align with those of their employers? I argue that firms with more specific assets are more vulnerable to adverse policy changes. Hence, the fate of jobs is tied more closely to the firm and employees are more likely to share political preferences with their employers. However, simultaneously observing both company and employee preferences is difficult in practice. First, I match 1,691,790 campaign contribution filings of 85,109 individuals to 874 publicly listed firms and 850 occupations using US campaign finance data between 2003 and 2016. I accomplish this by employing natural language processing techniques to automatically identify employer names and employee occupations. Second, I test my argument and find that employees in companies with more specific assets are more aligned with their employer, holding constant individual occupation. Finally, I show that most of the variation in alignment is at the industry level. These results highlight the continuing importance of sectoral models for political preferences formation, contrary to a current trend towards occupational models.


* **Political Uncertainty, FDI, and Trade in intermediate Goods: Evidence From Ukrainian Firms**, with Oleksandr Shepotylo, _under review_

  * **Abstract**: We extend a model with heterogeneous firms and argue that trade policy uncertainty (TPU) 
  negatively impacts firm-specific investment and firm-level decision to source intermediate goods. 
  We look at Ukraineâ€™s trade relations with EU and Russia to measure
  TPU and test our predictions. Ukrainian firms faced considerable uncertainty
  with regards to two mutually exclusive trade policies: the conclusion of a free trade
  agreement (FTA) with the European Union or a customs union with Russia. Using
  unique firm-product level data and FDI data of Ukrainian manufacturing firms between
  2003 and 2014, we find a substantive increase in firm-level FDI inflows and
  imported intermediate goods from EU countries, and a decrease in FDI from the Customs
  Union, once uncertainty with regards to the EU FTA is reduced. Moreover,
  more protected goods respond stronger to a reduction in TPU. The novel measure
  of uncertainty can be easily applied to other cases where governments face multiple
  mutually exclusive policy options.
