* **Political Alignment between Firms and Employees: The Role of Asset Specificity**

  * **Abstract**: In this paper, I investigate the economic sources of individuals’ political
preferences. When do individual political preferences of people
align with those of their employers? I theorize that firms and sectors with more specific
assets are more stuck in their geographic location and less adaptable in the case of
averse economic shocks. Therefore, employees should show more partisan alignment
if they work in firms or sectors with more specific assets. However, observing both
company and employee political preferences is difficult in practice.
First, I match 1,691,790 campaign contribution filings of 85,109 individuals to 874
publicly listed firms and 850 occupations using US campaign finance data between
2003 and 2016. I accomplish this by employing natural language processing techniques
to automatically identify employer names and employee occupations. Second,
I show that most of the variation in partisan alignment between company
and employee donations is at the industry level. Third, I find that employees in companies with more non-mobile assets are more
aligned. I also find that this relationship
differs by partisanship of alignment: while Republican alignment is higher in sectors
with more specific assets, Democratic alignment is systematically lower. Similarly, I
find that employees in the same firms and occupations are significantly more aligned
in red compared to blue states.


* **Political Uncertainty, FDI, and Trade in intermediate Goods: Evidence From Ukrainian Firms**, with Oleksandr Shepotylo, _under review_

  * **Abstract**: We extend a model with heterogeneous firms and argue that trade policy uncertainty (TPU) 
  negatively impacts firm-specific investment and firm-level decision to source intermediate goods. 
  We look at Ukraine’s trade relations with EU and Russia to measure
  TPU and test our predictions. Ukrainian firms faced considerable uncertainty
  with regards to two mutually exclusive trade policies: the conclusion of a free trade
  agreement (FTA) with the European Union or a customs union with Russia. Using
  unique firm-product level data and FDI data of Ukrainian manufacturing firms between
  2003 and 2014, we find a substantive increase in firm-level FDI inflows and
  imported intermediate goods from EU countries, and a decrease in FDI from the Customs
  Union, once uncertainty with regards to the EU FTA is reduced. Moreover,
  more protected goods respond stronger to a reduction in TPU. The novel measure
  of uncertainty can be easily applied to other cases where governments face multiple
  mutually exclusive policy options.
