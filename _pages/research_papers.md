<!-- **Political Alignment between Firms and Employees: Investment or Ideology?**, _work in progress_
  * **Abstract**: Does political alignment between firms and employees affect lobbying effectiveness of firms? Existing theoretical models lead to opposite theoretical expectations. Collective action theory would predict that more politically cohesive firms will be more likely to lobby and hence, be more effective in achieving their political goals. However, from an investment theory perspective firms which split donations equally between parties would lobby more effectively, hedging their bets in the case of political change. I theorize that politically aligned companies will be more likely to overcome collective action problems and engage in lobbying in the first place, but that companies splitting donations between parties will be more effective in getting preferred legislation passed, on average. I test these expectations using linked US campaign finance and lobbying data between 1999 and 2016. First, I match campaign donations of firms and employees to bill-level lobbying activity of the same companies. Second, I test the impact of alignment on the number of bills lobbied and the likelihood of bill passage. The paper reconciles collective action and investment theory perspectives on corporate political activity and provides an empirical contribution by linking large-scale data on lobbying and campaign donations at the firm-level. -->

**Political Alignment between Firms and Employees in the United States: Evidence from a new Dataset**, _first view, Political Science Research and Methods_, [Link](https://doi.org/10.1017/psrm.2020.19)
  * **Abstract**: I construct a novel measure of partisan alignment between firms and employees. This measure is constructed using data matching 1,691,790 US federal campaign contribution filings of 85,109 individuals to the donations of 874 Political Action Committees (PACs) of publicly listed US companies between 2003 and 2016. The alignment measure shows that employee and employer contributions are highly correlated. Furthermore, firm- and occupation-level factors are significantly associated with firm-employee alignment. Uniquely, these new data can be easily linked to external data on industries, firms, and occupations and consequently allow for in-depth analysis of precisely how companies can influence employees’ politics.

  **Political Alignment between Firms and Employees: Investment or Ideology?**, _work in progress_, [Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qw14qmgrkpv7mtd/political_alignment_Jan_Stuckatz.pdf?dl=0)
  * **Abstract**: How important is one’s employer for individual decisions to donate? Despite the fundamental role of employment for individual’s livelihoods, little attention has been given to how the workplace impacts employees’ political contributions. I use donations of employees and Political Action Committees (PACs) of 12,737 public companies between 2003 and 2018 to show that 16.7 percent of employee donations go to employer-supported politicians. I investigate the dynamic relationship between employee and PAC donations within firm-politician pairs over time and find that employees contribute 17.4% more dollars to company-supported politicians. Firm-employee alignment is stronger on powerful and ideologically moderate legislators with high value for one’s employer. Results from difference-in-differences designs show that high-ranking employees even change the partisanship of their donations in line with their employer, suggesting investment-related rather than ideological motives for alignment. In sum, corporations and the workplace might be even more important in shaping political contributions than previously thought.

 <!--- **Political Alignment between Firms and Employees: The Role of Asset Specificity**, _work in progress_, [Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8w2lrtmof3b64p2/firm_empl_align_apr19.pdf?dl=0)
  * **Abstract**: When do political preferences of employees align with those of their employers? Comparative and International Political Economy scholars debate whether sectors, firms, or occupations matter more for preference formation, highlighting the importance of asset specificity. While some empirical work confirms the impact of sectoral and firm specificity, others focus on occupational skill specificity. I investigate the impact of specificity on alignment using new data linking 1,691,790 campaign contributions by 85,109 employees to 874 corporate Political Action Committees between 2003 and 2016. I find that firm and sectoral specificity is associated with higher partisan alignment between firms and employees, but no evidence for the impact of occupational skill specificity. I also find that employees donate more to firm-supported candidates, which is driven by candidates likely to yield political returns. The results have implications for research on coalition formation, preference formation, and highlight differences between motivations for stated preferences and political actions --->

**Political Uncertainty and Trade in Intermediate and Capital Goods: Evidence From Ukrainian Firms**, with Oleksandr Shepotylo, _under review_
  * **Abstract**: We explore the effects of policy uncertainty on firm-level trade and introduce a new method to measure uncertainty using machine learning tools for quantitative text analysis. We extend a model with heterogeneous firms and sunk investments by adding intermediate inputs to derive hypotheses about the impact of trade policy uncertainty (TPU) on firm's decision to import intermediate and capital goods. We look at Ukraine’s trade relations with EU and Russia to measure TPU and test predictions of our model. Ukrainian firms faced considerable uncertainty with regards to two mutually exclusive trade policies: the conclusion of a free trade agreement with the European Union (EU FTA) or a customs union with Russia (RU CU). Using unique firm-product-destination level data from Ukrainian manufacturing firms between 2003 and 2014, we find a substantive increase in firm-level exports to and imports from EU countries, once uncertainty with regards to the EU FTA is reduced. In line with our expectations, more protected goods, intermediates, and capital goods respond stronger to the reduction in TPU. The novel measure of uncertainty can be easily applied to other cases where governments face multiple mutually exclusive policy options.   

  **Strategic Complementarities between Campaign Donations and Lobbying**, with In Song Kim and Lukas Wolters, _work in progress_
  * **Abstract**: We offer the first large scale analysis of the direct link between campaign donations and lobbying --- two distinct political activities that have been mostly studied separately. Using over 75 million lobbying reports and campaign contribution filings since 1999, merged at the level of interest groups and legislators, we demonstrate that interest groups not only target politicians strategically when they make donations, but also arrange the two activities sequentially. Specifically, we show that donations to politicians are directly related to subsequent lobbying efforts and the legislative activities of the targeted politicians. To analyze the sequential link, while accounting for potential confounding between the two activities, we use the difference-in-differences identification strategy combined with matching methods. In particular, we compare firms that make a donation to a politician against a set of comparable firms with no donation history to the same politician. We find that campaign donations result in an 8.5 percentage point increase in the probability that the targeted politician involves in legislative activities that are directly tied to the interests of the donating firm. The effects are large, short-term, and particularly pronounced for committee consideration. Our findings question the common perception of donations as mere consumption or long-term investment strategy.
